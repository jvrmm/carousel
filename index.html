  <!-- Added 2 options in this example: -->
  <!-- data-bs-interval = The amount of time to delay between automatically cycling an item. -->
  <!-- data-bs-pause = when you put the mouse on (hover), the carousel stopped in the item selected. -->
  <!-- The first thing is a div, that has the ID of the carousel that has to be unique across the page. -->
  <!-- Next, we add some custom bootstrap classes which defines what component it is "carousel" and if should animate from right or left "slide". -->
  <!-- I want a static carousel, so the option 'data-bs-ride' goes to "false" ("carousel" by default). -->
  <!-- As we have it static, we don't need 'data-bs-interval' anymore. Same to 'data-bs-pause' with the value "hover". -->
  <div id="testimonial-carousel" class="carousel slide" data-bs-ride="false">
    <!-- We've got the "carousel-inner", and this is going to containt the contents of the carousel items, so the slide that would be change. -->
    <div class="carousel-inner">
      <!-- Inside the "carousel-inner", we've got the 3 carousel items, and the first one, the first slide is match with an 'active' class (one of this carousel items, must have it.)-->
      <!-- The next thing, is the property 'style', that allow you to change some css properties (in this case the background to distinguish them). -->
      <div class="carousel-item active" style="background-color: red;">
        <!-- We can have an image, h1, or whatever we want to see in the carousel. -->
        <h1>Hello</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="carousel-item" style="background-color: black;">
        <h1>World</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="carousel-item" style="background-color: purple;">
        <h1>Bye</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- The ID '#testimonial-carousel' in the buttons, must be the same as the principal div ID. -->
    <!-- The "carousel-control-prev" is the left button of the carousel. -->
    <!-- Each button needs a target "#testimonial-carousel" that is the ID of this carousel, because we can have some carousels in the webpage and have to be differents IDs to work. -->
    <!-- Next property is the 'data-bs-slide' that have the value "prev". This shows you the direction of the slide (left or backwards in this case). -->
    <button class="carousel-control-prev" type="button" data-bs-target="#testimonial-carousel" data-bs-slide="prev">
      <!-- This is the arrows icons of the carousel. This comes from the bootstrap class "carousel-control-prev-icon". -->
      <!-- Setting the property 'aria-hidden' to "true", makes the screen reader skipper with this button interval, so the visually impaired person doesn't have to listen to all the buttons are. -->
      <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
      <span class="visually-hidden">Previous</span>
    </button>
    <button class="carousel-control-next" type="button" data-bs-target="#testimonial-carousel" data-bs-slide="next">
      <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
      <span class="visually-hidden">Next</span>
